# PDF Quick Magnifier

A client-side web application to create magnified detail views (callouts) on your PDF files. Upload a PDF, select an area on any page, and click an empty spot to place a magnified version, complete with an arrow pointing to the source. All processing is done directly in your browser, ensuring your files remain private.

## üíª Local Development

**Critical Note:** This application uses modern JavaScript modules (`import`/`export`). For security reasons, web browsers do not allow these modules to be loaded from local files (`file:///...`). Therefore, you **must** use a simple local web server to run this application. Simply opening the `index.html` file by double-clicking it in your file explorer **will not work** and will result in a script or CORS error.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd [your-project-directory]
    ```

3.  **Start a local server.**
    If you have Python 3 installed, you can use this command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use a tool like the "Live Server" extension for Visual Studio Code.

4.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port your server is running on).
